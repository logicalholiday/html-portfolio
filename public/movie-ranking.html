<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Well, top 3 for now anyway</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Merlin</h3>
<p>One of the best adaptations of the disparate Arthur/Merlin myths in one whole. All star cast.</p>
<h3>American Psycho</h3>
<p>People forget that this is actually the greatest dark comedy of all time.</p>
<h3>Super Mario Bros.</h3>
<p>Terrible movie, but it kept me smiling the entire time</p>
